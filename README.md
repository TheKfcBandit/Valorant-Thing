## Features

### Agent Instalock

Pick a default agent or configure **per-map selections** — the app automatically selects and locks your agent the instant you enter agent select. Agents are displayed in a **role-grouped grid** (Duelist, Initiator, Controller, Sentinel) with role filter buttons matching the real game's agent select screen. Unowned agents show a lock icon overlay. Configurable select and lock delays for fine-tuning.

**Profiles** — Save multiple agent configurations as named profiles. Switch between setups instantly.

### Map Dodge

Blacklist maps you don't want to play. Maps are split into **Standard** and **Deathmatch** sections. When the app detects a blacklisted map in agent select, it auto-dodges. Simple as that.

### Fake Status

Spoof your Valorant presence via **XMPP** — show any rank, level, game state, player card, title, and Premier info to anyone viewing your profile. Toggle on/off with live XMPP log viewer. Unsaved changes are caught with a save/discard prompt when navigating away.

### Live Match Info

See all players in your current match with their **agents, ranks, RR, and account levels**. Works in both agent select and in-game. Shows the current map, game mode, server, and live score.

### Party Management

View party members, kick players, generate/join party codes, toggle open/closed party, invite friends, request to join, and manage queue state — all from one page.

### Notifications

Get overlay notifications for **match found** (with map name), **agent locking** (countdown), **agent locked** (confirmation), **dodge**, and **queue actions**. Choose which **monitor** notifications appear on and pick a corner position (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right). Notifications render in a transparent overlay window that doesn't steal the game focus.

### Share Codes & Cloud Sync

Share your agent profiles, custom themes, and full app configs with a single code:

- `VT-AGENT-XXXXX` — Agent profile
- `VT-THEME-XXXXX` — Custom theme
- `VT-CONFIG-XXXXX` — Full settings

Import/export via share codes or `.vt` files. Cloud API powered by Rust (`reqwest`), no JS fetch.

### Discord Rich Presence

Shows your current activity in Discord:

- Game phase (lobby, agent select, in-game)
- Locked agent name and live match score
- Active features (autolocking, map dodging)

### Customization

**8 built-in themes** (Crimson Moon, Radianite, Midnight Blurple, Chroma Glow, Forest, Mars, Dusk) plus a **fully custom theme builder** with gradient angle editor, color stop picker, and live preview. Simplified mode strips the gradient for a flat look.

### Queue Automation

- **Auto Unqueue** — Automatically leaves queue when someone dodges
- **Auto Requeue** — Instantly requeues after a match ends

### System Integration

- **System tray** — Minimize to tray, left-click to restore, right-click for Show/Quit
- **Start with Windows** — Auto-launch on boot, optionally minimized to tray
- **Close with game** — Exit the app when Valorant closes

### Developer Tools

Hidden debug page — run `__VT_DEV()` in the console to enable. Includes log viewer, notification tester, cloud save/load tester, and state inspector.

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌───────────────────┐     ┌────────────────────┐
│  React Frontend │────▶│   Rust Backend    │────▶│   Riot APIs       │
│  (Tauri WebView)│◀────│   (Tauri Commands)│◀────│  (Local + Remote) │
└─────────────────┘     └───────────────────┘     └────────────────────┘
```

**Local Valorant Client API** — Reads the lockfile for port + auth token. Used for entitlement tokens, chat, presence data, and XMPP.

**Riot PD / GLZ APIs** — Authenticated remote endpoints for player data, MMR, match details, agent select/lock, party management, queue state, and dodge.

**valorant-api.com** — Public community API for static assets (agent icons, map images, rank icons, player cards/titles).

**Splooshima API** _(optional fallback)_ — Third-party API for extended player info when Riot's endpoints don't return enough data.

**VT Cloud** (`vt-cloud.ajaxfnc.com`) — Share code storage for profiles, themes, and configs. No auth required.

All API calls happen in the **Rust backend** — the React frontend never touches credentials directly.
